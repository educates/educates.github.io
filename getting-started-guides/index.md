an educational framework for building workshops powered by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

The outline of these guides look like this:

1. [Prerequisites and Setup](/getting-started-guides/setup)
2. [How does Educates work?](/getting-started-guides/about)
3. [Creating workshops](/getting-started-guides/authoring)
4. Publishing and deploying our first workshop
