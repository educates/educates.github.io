# Getting Started Guides

Over the next hours, we will take a look at [Educates](https://educates.dev),
an educational framework for building workshops powered by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

The outline will look like this:

1. [Prerequisites and Setup](setup)
2. [How does Educates work?](about)
3. [Creating workshops](authoring)
4. Publishing and deploying our first workshop

Let's get hacking! ðŸš€
