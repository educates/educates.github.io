I am happy to announce a significant change regarding the [Educates project](https://educates.dev), an interactive training platform for hands-on labs hosted on Kubernetes.

Educates was a collaborative open source initiative spearheaded by [Graham Dumpleton](https://github.com/grahamdumpleton) and myself ([Jorge Morales](https://github.com/jorgemoralespou)) which has been developed over the past five years. It was initially developed while working for VMware, and subsequently Broadcom following their acquisition of VMware.

Recently however, both Graham and myself were impacted by the latest round of cuts by Broadcom subsequent to the takeover of VMware. This left Broadcom in possession of the Educates project without active maintainers.

After various discussions, Broadcom had agreed to move the project under full community stewardship. Henceforth, the project will reside within its own GitHub organization (https://github.com/educates), enabling independent development of Educates separate from any corporate entity. This will allow us to continue to work on Educates and we also hope it will foster wider community adoption.

Furthermore, we have also established a dedicated project website, https://educates.dev, intended to provide comprehensive resources and guidance for individuals seeking to adopt Educates as their preferred free and open-source hands-on labs platform.

This milestone signifies a pivotal moment for the project, and the coming months will be devoted to nurturing its growth and expanding the community.

Our team is driven by the unwavering conviction to extend the concept of hands-on training platforms to wherever users may require them.
