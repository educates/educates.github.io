We are excited to announce the launch of **Educates Hub**, the official resource aggregator for the Educates community! You can explore it today at [https://hub.educates.dev](https://hub.educates.dev).

Educates Hub is your new central destination for discovering, sharing, and managing resources for your workshops. Our goal is to create a vibrant ecosystem where the community can easily access high-quality content and tools to make the most out of Educates.

### What You'll Find at Launch

From day one, Educates Hub will be populated with a variety of resources, including:

*   **Workshops:** A curated collection of workshops on various topics, ready for you to use and adapt, some of these showcase Educates capabilities.
*   **Extension Packages:** Enhance your workshops with additional features and capabilities developed by the community. Binaries, additional CLIs and VScode extensions are an example of what can be provided this way.

### What's on the Horizon?

We are just getting started! In the near future, we plan to expand the Hub to include even more resource types, such as:

*   **Themes:** Customize the appearance of your workshop environment.
*   **Kyverno Policies:** Share and enforce best practices and security policies within your workshops and installations.

### A Community Effort

Educates Hub is more than just a repository; it's a community-driven platform. We invite you to not only use the resources available but also to contribute your own creations. By sharing your work, you help the entire Educates community grow and learn together.
